# Advanced Programming Challenges

This repository is a personal challenge designed to strengthen my **hard skills** in software development. It focuses on solving complex programming problems and implementing solid software architecture using a variety of technologies.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

The main objectives of this project are:

- Enhance general programming and mathematical and algorithmical problem-solving skills using **ANSI C**.
- Implement **design patterns** and **software architecture principles** using **C++** and **TypeScript**.
- Improve proficiency in **SQL** and take it to the next level by working with different **DBMS** (Database Management Systems), including advanced usage as a **DBA** with **Oracle**.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Languages:**  
  - C (ANSI C)  
  - C++  
  - TypeScript

- **Database Management Systems (DBMS):**  
  - SQLite  
  - MySQL  
  - PostgreSQL  
  - Oracle (11g, 12c, 19c, 21c)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Sharpen mental agility and algorithmic thinking by tackling challenging problems using **C**.
- Apply professional best practices in software design using **C++** and **TypeScript**.
- Deepen database knowledge across various systems and focus on **Oracle DBA** skills and optimization.
